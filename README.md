Remake of http://energy.maryland.gov/map/index.html

This project has been depricated and retired. Some dependencies are no longer available through npm. It was last reported as working on Node.js v6.x.x.

Starting the project followed these steps:

- Use the template of `config/config.sample.js` to create a file `config/config.js` with real configuration data.
- Install node dependencies for the project with `npm install`.
- Start the app with `npm start`.
